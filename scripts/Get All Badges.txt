-- This script will get all badges on Roblox

-- First, we need to get the list of all badges
local badges = game:GetService("BadgeService"):GetBadgeInfo()

-- Now, we can loop through the list and get each badge
for _, badge in pairs(badges) do
 -- Get the badge
 local badgeObject = game:GetService("BadgeService"):GetBadgeInfo(badge.Id)
 
 -- Check if the badge is owned
 if not badgeObject.IsOwned then
  -- If not, then we can award it
  game:GetService("BadgeService"):AwardBadge(badge.Id)
 end
end

-- All badges should now be awarded!
